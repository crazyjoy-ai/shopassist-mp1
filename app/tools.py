"""ShopAssist's tools - YOU own this file.

Three tools, all READ-ONLY: they look things up and check rules. None of them cancels, refunds or changes anything -
actions that change data need a human approval step (Module 6), so customers do those on the website.

Remember Session 21, Section 7: type hints catch "abc", but they don't catch a WRONG VALUE. A tool that gets a
nonsense argument must RAISE ValueError with a message that says what's wrong. agent.run_tool() turns that into an
"INVALID: ..." message for the model, so the model asks the customer instead of guessing (S20's Fix B).
